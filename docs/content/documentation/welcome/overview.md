This is a work-in-progress re-alignment of **VMware Secrets Manager** v0.x.

The project is in active development, and we will update the documentation
when the dust settles.

You can check out the project's progress in the
[feature/v2.0.0-preview](https://github.com/vmware/secrets-manager/tree/feature/v2.0.0-preview)

Thanks for your patience.
